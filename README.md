# hw2
hw2 for csci104 usc 
1. Extension (3 days applied) : Health emergency condition due a crime incident. 
2. Obstacles I have encountered and how I fixed errors and compiling issues: 
- The structures and the relationship between different classes (Inheritance and Polymorphism) made me a little confused about how to consturct new classes,
and what functions to use and include. 
- The second thing is when it comes to part 2, basically in amazon.cpp, I need to think of different situations of user's situations and their commands, 
and think of what to put in mydatabase.cpp/h as well. 
- Finally, when it comes to compiling and testing, I had seg fault at the beginning and I used gdb and some help from OH, I realized that my logic and some 
syntax for search function is wrong. I fixed them bit by bit by going to related functions. 
- Note: One last problem I had was I couldn't make it work if a user add two same products. And I realized that I used a set instead of vector for the cart 
function and because set doesn't allow me to have 2 same products it all has to be different so I changed that to vector and its finally working ! :)
